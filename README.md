## Homework from [Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science CS50 hosted on eDX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)
## üéì [Web Track](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/)
-   [Finance](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/finance/): Web application via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. This tool allows you to check real stocks‚Äô actual prices and portfolios‚Äô values, it will also let you buy (okay, ‚Äúbuy‚Äù) and sell (okay, ‚Äúsell‚Äù) stocks by querying [IEX](iexcloud.io/) for stocks‚Äô prices.
-   I wrote all the code in the templates directory. I wrote most of the code in application.py. Some of the code in helpers.py was provided by instructor
-   I styled the application myself, with illustrations provided by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/). Landing page and favicon cloned after [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/)

## ‚úÖ Project Status
-	  Add tests

## üöÄ Getting Started
To run this project locally:
-   In your terminal, navigate to the root project directory and run the following commands
-   To install the dependencies
```
$ pipenv install flask flask-session flask-sqlalchemy requests flask-marshmallow marshmallow-sqlalchemy
```
-   You'll need to register for an API key in order to be able to query IEX‚Äôs data
-   [Register](iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/) for an account
-   Enter your email address and a password, and click ‚ÄúCreate account‚Äù
-   On the next page, scroll down to choose the Start (free) plan
-   Once you‚Äôve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, sign in to iexcloud.io
-   Click API Tokens
-   Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with pk_)
-   Create a .env file and paste the following code into it
```
$ API_KEY=<value>
```
-   To start the web server, execute (without debugging):
```
$ python application.py 
```
-   Alternatively, execute (without debugging):
```
$ export FLASK_APP=application.py
$ flask run
```
